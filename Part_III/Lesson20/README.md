# Boston Housing Dataset Classification

This repository hosts the code, tests, documentation and pipelined model for the analysis undertaken of the Boston House Price dataset.

## About the Dataset: Boston Housing

The repository is hosted at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/)

The data set is multivariate and contains ratio(numerical) and nominal data.
There are 506 instances and 14 attributes.
