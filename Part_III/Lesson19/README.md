# Iris Flowers Dataset Classification

This repository hosts the code, tests, documentation and pipelined model for the analysis undertaken of the iris flowers dataset.

## About the Dataset: Iris Flowers

The repository is hosted at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/)

The data set is multivariate and contains ratio(numerical) and nominal data.
There are 150 instances and 4 attributes.
