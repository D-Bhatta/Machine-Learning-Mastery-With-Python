    """ ### Tips for using the template

    - Fast First Pass . Make a first-pass through the project steps as fast as possible. This
    will give you confidence that you have all the parts that you need and a baseline from
    which to improve.
    - Cycles . The process in not linear but cyclic. You will loop between steps, and probably
    spend most of your time in tight loops between steps 3-4 or 3-4-5 until you achieve a level
    of accuracy that is sufficient or you run out of time.
    - Attempt Every Step . It is easy to skip steps, especially if you are not confident or
    familiar with the tasks of that step. Try and do something at each step in the process,
    even if it does not improve accuracy. You can always build upon it later. Donâ€™t skip steps,
    just reduce their contribution.
    - Ratchet Accuracy . The goal of the project is model accuracy. Every step contributes
    towards this goal. Treat changes that you make as experiments that increase accuracy as
    the golden path in the process and reorganize other steps around them. Accuracy is a
    ratchet that can only move in one direction (better, not worse).
    - Adapt As Needed . Modify the steps as you need on a project, especially as you become
    more experienced with the template. Blur the edges of tasks, such as steps 4-5 to best
    serve model accuracy. """
