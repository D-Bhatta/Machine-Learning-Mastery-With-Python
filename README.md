Initiated Project:24th August 2019

This is a repository of all activities as I learn from the book "Machine Learning Mastery With Python by Jason Brownlee"

The code repository will be divided into 2 Parts:

Part II
Contains the activities from the 16 lessons therein
They are(not exact chapter names):
Lesson 1: Python Ecosystem for Machine Learning.
Lesson 2: Python and SciPy Crash Course.
Lesson 3: Load Datasets from CSV.
Lesson 4: Understand Data With Descriptive Statistics. (Analyze Data)
Lesson 5: Understand Data With Visualization. (Analyze Data)
Lesson 6: Pre-Process Data. (Prepare Data)
Lesson 7: Feature Selection. (Prepare Data)
Lesson 8: Resampling Methods. (Evaluate Algorithms)
Lesson 9: Algorithm Evaluation Metrics. (Evaluate Algorithms)
Lesson 10: Spot-Check Classification Algorithms. (Evaluate Algorithms)
Lesson 11: Spot-Check Regression Algorithms. (Evaluate Algorithms)
Lesson 12: Model Selection. (Evaluate Algorithms)
Lesson 13: Pipelines. (Evaluate Algorithms)
Lesson 14: Ensemble Methods. (Improve Results)
Lesson 15: Algorithm Parameter Tuning. (Improve Results)
Lesson 16: Model Finalization. (Present Results)

Each Lesson will have a folder for itself. Within that will be the code, documents, screenshots, tests, etc. for all the activities of the lesson. Each Lesson file should have the lesson number followed by page number in a comment at the top of the file.

Part III
Contains the activities from the 3 projects therein
They are:

1.Hello World Project (Iris flowers dataset) : This is a quick pass through the project steps
without much tuning or optimizing on a dataset that is widely used as the hello world of
machine learning.

2.Regression (Boston House Price dataset) : Work through each step of the project process
with a regression problem.

3.Binary Classification (Sonar dataset) : Work through each step of the project process
using all of the methods on a binary classification problem.

Datasets from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml

Each Project will have a folder for itself. Within that will be the code, documents, screenshots, tests, etc. for all the activities of the project.

It might be prudent to host each project in it's own repository. To do so, git replace the root of each project onto the HEAD of this repository.

Each commit should look like:

"Create file for <lesson>_<section>_<useCase>_<date> as <fileName>"
"Modify file for <lesson>_<section>_<useCase>_<date> as <fileName>"
"Write tests for <lesson>_<section>_<useCase>_<date> as <fileName>"
"Results for <lesson>_<section>_<useCase>_<date> as <fileName>"
"Update README.md for <lesson>_<section>_<useCase>_<date>"
"Update README.md with Introductory information corrections"

...with other relevant commits in between. It is better to be relevant than to be adherent to the above rules. Break them as necessary.


This project will enable me to do the following:
1. Define Problem : Investigate and characterize the problem in order to better understand
the goals of the project.
2. Analyze Data : Use descriptive statistics and visualization to better understand the data
you have available.
3. Prepare Data : Use data transforms in order to better expose the structure of the
prediction problem to modeling algorithms.
4. Evaluate Algorithms : Design a test harness to evaluate a number of standard algorithms
on the data and select the top few to investigate further.
5. Improve Results : Use algorithm tuning and ensemble methods to get the most out of
well-performing algorithms on your data.
6. Present Results: Finalize the model, make predictions and present results.

README.md should have all the relevant information laid out. They should be then used to update the resume and portfolio. It is
